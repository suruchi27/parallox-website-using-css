      Gawanâ€™s rise can be attributed to both his administrative ability as well as his network of contacts throughout the Persian-speaking world. His correspondence included letters to the monarchs of Turkey, Iraq and Egypt. Scholars were invited to settle at Bidar and the place gradually became a center of learning. The highlight of this aspect was the magnificent madrasa constructed under his patronage at Bidar. The madrasa library held over 3,000 books. Regular commercial relations between Bidar and the countries of the Middle East were organized.
